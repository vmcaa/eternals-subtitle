1
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:05,680
Something is coming! Save yourselves!

2
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:10,913
Father!

3
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:12,419
Run!

4
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,321
Good job.

5
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:00,767
You too.

6
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:41,755
Don't be afraid.

7
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:45,078
Fast! Go inside!

8
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:55,363
The world and its wonders are upon you.

9
00:24:56,432 --> 00:24:59,215
Follow Gilgamesh and Enkidu
in their battle.

10
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:04,043
May their strength and bravery
make you fearless.

11
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:07,261
May you and your human brothers

12
00:25:07,912 --> 00:25:10,666
live extraordinary adventures,

13
00:25:11,255 --> 00:25:13,998
and become legends.

14
00:25:56,438 --> 00:26:00,204
I was looking for objects
to exchange for the tablet.

15
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:06,217
You just have to lie.

16
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:15,038
I perceive the slightest vibrations.

17
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:17,998
Even the smallest,

18
00:26:18,258 --> 00:26:21,395
like your voice when you speak.

19
00:26:23,002 --> 00:26:25,836
Are you wasting my time?

20
00:26:26,603 --> 00:26:28,644
The emerald tablet

21
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:30,514
is just a legend.

22
00:26:45,462 --> 00:26:47,631
When humans conflict among themselves,

23
00:26:47,946 --> 00:26:50,701
Ajak does not want us to interfere.

24
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:01,104
I won't say if you won't.

25
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:16,263
See you later.

26
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:18,729
Let me help you.

27
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:49,777
You are very kind.

28
00:28:58,976 --> 00:29:00,327
I am very beautiful.

29
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:46,757
May the Gods unite you
with the bond of this marriage.

30
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:48,831
Congratulations.

31
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:34,011
We separated.

32
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,379
Be strong.

33
00:39:10,629 --> 00:39:13,091
But it won't be Thena anymore.

34
00:42:54,508 --> 00:42:56,398
<i>Come to me.</i>

35
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:03,496
<i>You, our savior.</i>

36
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,264
<i>You are back</i>

37
00:43:11,043 --> 00:43:14,402
<i>with us again, give us hope.</i>

38
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:18,063
<i>You risked everything for our victory.</i>

39
00:43:18,544 --> 00:43:20,068
<i>Waiting for you again</i>

40
00:43:20,315 --> 00:43:22,204
<i>is impossible for me.</i>

41
00:43:58,676 --> 00:43:59,768
Welcome.

42
01:05:03,585 --> 01:05:04,868
Greetings.

43
01:05:14,471 --> 01:05:16,810
Hi, we are looking for Druig.

44
01:05:17,158 --> 01:05:18,067
Is he here?

45
01:05:18,382 --> 01:05:20,199
Yes. How do you know Druig?

46
01:05:21,314 --> 01:05:22,552
He's a friend...

47
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:24,662
from the university.

48
01:12:22,211 --> 01:12:25,528
Ma'am, is everything all right?

49
01:15:37,393 --> 01:15:38,467
What is happening?

50
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:46,708
You should go, my love.

51
01:28:52,085 --> 01:28:55,007
Stop procrastinating
and go solve your problems.

52
01:31:31,157 --> 01:31:33,402
That's it, we are finally going home?

53
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:01,812
Are you telling me

54
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:05,985
that Olympia I've been waiting
for ages to go back to,

55
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:10,005
in fact does not exist?

56
01:32:14,372 --> 01:32:16,290
At least I'm not
going to be bored anymore.

57
01:32:20,721 --> 01:32:22,591
I don't have a DVD player.

58
01:34:00,993 --> 01:34:04,427
Let's assume Druig succeeds
putting Tiamut to sleep.

59
01:34:05,467 --> 01:34:06,508
What then?

60
01:48:12,994 --> 01:48:13,895
I found Tiamut.

61
01:49:12,772 --> 01:49:14,766
Why did she go with Ikaris?

62
01:49:58,445 --> 01:49:59,619
We need you.

63
01:50:16,221 --> 01:50:17,987
Thank you for all you've done

64
01:50:20,146 --> 01:50:21,552
for humanity.

65
01:50:23,202 --> 01:50:25,675
It was a great honor.

66
01:50:28,308 --> 01:50:30,307
I will miss you.

67
01:50:57,341 --> 01:50:59,243
You've never done it before.

68
02:14:18,742 --> 02:14:21,308
We became one...

69
02:14:23,667 --> 02:14:26,263
even Ikaris and Sprite,

70
02:14:27,141 --> 02:14:32,593
thanks to Tiamut.

71
02:17:42,683 --> 02:17:43,898
He is ten years old,

72
02:17:44,506 --> 02:17:45,880
he is not stupid.

73
02:18:34,648 --> 02:18:36,860
The truth will set them free.
